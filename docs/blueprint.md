## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to reflect the tech industry.
- Background color: A light gray (#F5F5F5) for light mode and a dark gray (#333333) for dark mode, providing contrast and readability.
- Accent color: A shade of green (#90EE90) to add a subtle but noticeable highlight.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headings to maintain a modern and fashionable feel. Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for main text because this combination will increase readability while keeping with the spirit of modern design.
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Employ a set of clear and modern icons (using react-icons) that align with the theme of each section, ensuring they are distinct and easily recognizable.
- Adopt a modern and clean layout, utilizing a grid system for responsive design. Focus on clean spacing, large rounded corners, and accessibility in the code.
- Implement subtle animations using Tailwind CSS transitions and transforms (or framer-motion) for hover and scroll effects.
